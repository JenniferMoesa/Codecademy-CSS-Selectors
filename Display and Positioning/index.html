<!-- display property: inline, block, and inline-block. -->

<!-- INLINE
  The default display for some elements, such as <em>, <strong>, and <a>, is called inline. 
  Inline elements have a box that wraps tightly around their content,
  only taking up the amount of space necessary to display their content
  and not requiring a new line after each element.
  The height and width of these elements cannot be specified in the CSS document. -->

<!-- BLOCK 
  Some elements are not displayed in the same line as the content around them. 
  These are called block-level elements. 
  These elements fill the entire width of the page by default, but their width property can also be set
  Elements that are block-level by default include all levels of heading elements (<h1> through <h6>), <p>, <div> and <footer>.  -->


<!-- INLINE-BLOCK
  The third value for the display property is inline-block.
  Inline-block display combines features of both inline and block elements.
  Inline-block elements can appear next to each other and we can specify their dimensions using the width and height properties. 
  Images are the best example of default inline-block elements. -->
